# Towers of Hanoi

#### Objective: 

To understand the problem of the Towers of Hanoi and how it can be solved using recursion.

#### Required Time: 30 minutes

#### Difficulty Level: Medium

#### Scenario: 

You are given three towers (A, B, and C) and a number of disks on tower A. The disks are of different sizes and stacked in decreasing order, with the largest disk at the bottom. Your task is to move all the disks from tower A to tower C using tower B as an intermediate tower. You can only move one disk at a time, and you cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.

#### Task list:

* Take input n (number of disks) from the user.
* Define a recursive function to move the disks from tower A to tower C using tower B as an intermediate tower.
* Call the recursive function to move the disks.
* Print the steps taken to move the disks.


#### Expected/Sample Output:

Input: 3 <br>
Output: <br>
Move disk 1 from tower A to tower C <br>
Move disk 2 from tower A to tower B <br>
Move disk 1 from tower C to tower B <br>
Move disk 3 from tower A to tower C <br>
Move disk 1 from tower B to tower A <br>
Move disk 2 from tower B to tower C <br>
Move disk 1 from tower A to tower C <br>
